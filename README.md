# TreeView in Swift iOS

A TreeView is a hierarchical representation of data that allows users to expand and collapse nodes to navigate through the hierarchy. In Swift for iOS, a common approach to implementing a TreeView is by using a UITableView with custom cells.

## Basic Implementation Steps

1. **Create a Node Structure**: Define a struct or class to represent a node in the tree. Each node should have properties like `value`, `children`, and `isExpanded`.

2. **Create a Custom Cell**: Create a UITableViewCell subclass to display each node in the tree. The cell should have outlets for displaying the node's value and a disclosure button for expanding and collapsing.

3. **Implement UITableViewDataSource Methods**: Use UITableViewDataSource methods to populate the table view with nodes. Handle the expand/collapse logic in these methods.

4. **Handle Expand/Collapse**: Implement the logic to expand and collapse nodes when the disclosure button is tapped. Update the data model and reload the table view accordingly.

5. **Recursive Approach**: Consider using a recursive approach to handle the hierarchical nature of the tree. Use a recursive function to populate cells and handle expand/collapse actions.

## Example Code

Here's a basic example of how you might define a `TreeNode` struct and a custom `TreeViewCell` class in Swift:

```swift
struct TreeNode {
    var value: String
    var children: [TreeNode]
    var isExpanded: Bool
}

class TreeViewCell: UITableViewCell {
    @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet weak var disclosureButton: UIButton!
    var disclosureButtonTapAction: (() -> Void)?

    @IBAction func disclosureButtonTapped(_ sender: UIButton) {
        disclosureButtonTapAction?()
    }
}
```
## Here's a basic example of how you might organize your files and folders:

```
TreeviewProject
├── Models
│   └── TreeNode.swift
├── Views
│   └── TreeViewCell.swift
├── Controllers
│   └── TreeViewController.swift
├── Data
│   └── TreeData.json
├── Resources
│   └── Main.storyboard
└── Supporting Files
    └── AppDelegate.swift

```

1. **Models**: This folder contains the `TreeNode` struct or class that represents a node in your tree structure.

2. **Views**: The `TreeViewCell` class and any other custom views related to the TreeView are placed here.

3. **Controllers**: The `TreeViewController` class, which manages the TreeView, is located here.

4. **Data**: The TreeJson.json file would contain the hierarchical data that represents the structure of your TreeView. For example, it might look like this.

5. **Resources**: Storyboard files (like `Main.storyboard`) or any other resources used in your project.

6. **Supporting Files**: Contains the `AppDelegate` and other supporting files for your project.

<div style="display: flex;">
    <img src="TreeTable,png" alt="alt text" width="200">
</div>

You can adjust this structure based on the complexity and size of your project. For example, you might create separate folders for protocols, extensions, or networking components if needed.

This is just a basic outline to get you started with implementing a TreeView in Swift for iOS. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to customize the implementation further.
